### Hi,
This is an online library app that I developed to enhance my skills in Node.js with React and TypeScript. Currently, the app primarily focuses on showcasing books, facilitating book sharing, enabling book posting, user creation, and providing a seamless search experience to find the perfect book to read.

## Setting up development environment
Run the following commands on repo root for FE
> _yarn install_
>
Run the following commands on repo root for BE
> _npm install_


## Running Apps
Run the following commands on repo root for FE

> _yarn start_
> 
Run the following commands on repo root for BE
> _npm run devStart_

### Branching Guide
In a Monorepo, it becomes necessary to have some pattern to name your branches, as to add meaning to the PRs that are created.


**For FE**

_`library/<feature_name>`_

> e.g. library/feature-name
> 
**For BE**

_`library/<feature_name>`_

> e.g. library/feature-name
> 
**For UI**

_`library/<feature_name>`_




> e.g. library/feature-name


### Folder Structure for components
 There are two folders: 'fe-library' and 'be-library.' The 'fe-library' folder contains all the front-end (FE) related code, while the 'be-library' folder houses the back-end (BE) related code.
