### Hi,
this is online library app. I made this app to learn nodejs with React ts. For now
this app is mainly for showing books, sharing books, posting book, creating user, searching prefect book to read and
also to get daily updates on what's going on.

### Branching Guide
In a Monorepo, it becomes necessary to have some pattern to name your branches, as to add meaning to the PRs that are created.


**For FE**

_`library/<feature_name>`_

> e.g. library/feature-name
> 
**For BE**

_`library/<feature_name>`_

> e.g. library/feature-name
> 
**For UI**

_`library/<feature_name>`_

> e.g. library/feature-name


### Folder Structure for components
 There are two folder one is fe-library and other one is be-library. All fe related code 
 can be found under fe-library and for be you can find under be-library.
